        "description": "AFTER EVERYTHING, the fifth and final installment of the worldwide phenomena, finds Tessa and Hardin living separate lives after Hardin published his revealing book without her knowledge. Alone in England, Hardin retreats into drinking and other harmful habits. To make things worse, he’s suffering from writer’s block and may have to return his sizable advance if he doesn’t finish a new manuscript soon. Rather than give in to his demons, Hardin starts to realize that the only way to move forward – and have any chance of winning back Tessa – is to right wrongs from his past. He travels to Portugal to visit Natalie, a woman he once treated terribly. By spending time with Natalie and realizing she has moved on, Hardin is finally able to forgive himself and envision a bright future with the woman he loves. Meanwhile, back in the States, Landon and Nora prepare for their upcoming wedding – where Tessa and Hardin will be in attendance. Can the couple who have been through it all forgive each other and make the ultimate commitment? Written and directed by Castille Landon and based on characters from the best-selling book series by Anna Todd, AFTER EVERYTHING concludes the hit franchise series starring Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Josephine Langford, Mimi Keene, Benjamin Mascolo, Louise Lombard and Stephen Moyer.",
